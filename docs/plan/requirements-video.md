- Today, we will present the planned key requirements and functionalities of our project.

## 2. Project Purpose and Unique Value Proposition (UVP)
- "The purpose of our Peer Review Application is to enhance assignment grading through a peer-review system, simplifying workflows for students, instructors, and administrators. Our system aims to provide consistent and reliable feedback from multiple perspectives."
- "Our unique value proposition lies in our intuitive architecture with differentiated user roles, an automated peer review system ensuring fair and anonymous evaluations, and comprehensive progress tracking for both students and instructors."

## 3. Measurable Project Objectives and Success Criteria
- "Our primary objectives include creating an intuitive, efficient, and secure platform for managing assignments and peer reviews, implementing role-based access control, and streamlining assignment submission and peer-reviewed feedback processes."
- "Success will be measured by effective account creation and authentication services, role-based access control, user-friendly dashboards for monitoring progress and assignment statuses, and robust system security and data privacy measures."

## 4. User Groups and Usage Scenarios
- "Our main user groups are students, instructors, and administrators. Students will use the platform to submit assignments, participate in peer reviews, create groups and participate in group peer reviews, and track their progress."
- "Instructors will create and manage assignments, classes, and groups, oversee peer reviews, and monitor student progress. Administrators will manage user accounts, ensure system security, perform maintenance tasks, and respond to user reports."
- "Specific usage scenarios include students registering and logging in, viewing class dashboards, submitting assignments, and participating in peer reviews. Instructors will register, log in, create classes and assignments, assign peer reviews, and monitor progress. Administrators will manage accounts, system settings, and maintenance tasks, as well as receive and respond to user reports."

## 5. Functional Requirements
- "Our functional requirements include user management features like account creation, login, password reset, and role-based access control, along with notifications via Email."
- "Assignment management functionalities allow instructors to create and manage assignments and rubrics, handle submissions in various formats, manage deadlines, and provide feedback. The peer review process includes the distribution of assignments, anonymous reviews, and feedback submission."
- "We also have group project evaluations, where instructors and students can create and manage groups, participate in anonymous peer reviews within groups, and ensure fairness through fairness mechanisms."
